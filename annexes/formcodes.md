# Formcodes

Formcode is defining the shape of cross-section and how it is oriented according to used LCS. Due to defining the formcode for CSS, exchange of SAF files between applications that are differently handling LCS is possible.

{% hint style="info" %}
Formcode of manufactured cross-section, together with the attribute "**LCS of cross-section**" from the sheet [Project and model specification](../project-and-model-specifications/#project) is defining the exact orientation of cross-section in the model.

Formocode set to "**0**" means that receiving application won't do any action ensuring the proper positioning of CSS.
